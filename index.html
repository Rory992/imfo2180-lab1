		<p>I am currently enrolled at The University of The West Indies, Mona where I am reading for bachelors in Information Technology. I have always been interested in computers, how they work and the possibilities for their use.
		I like Web Development mostly for the fact that it provides tools through which one can be free to explore and express their creative mind and design web pages for others use.</p>
